## Hi, I'm Michelle 👋

I'm building a strong foundation in cybersecurity with a focus on Linux, blue team skills, and hands-on learning. I recently completed the CompTIA trifecta (Security+, CySA+, and Network+), and I'm actively working through Linux books and labs to deepen my technical comfort.

This repository documents my progress, practice, and projects as I move through:

- 📚 Linux learning (books + hands-on practice)
- 💻 RangeForce modules and labs
- 🔧 Command-line exercises
- 🛡️ Blue team tools and concepts
- 🧠 Notes, walkthroughs, and experiments

I'm learning in public so I can share the process with others who can relate. My goal is to build a strong technical foundation, develop confidence, and transition into a cybersecurity role.

If you're on a similar journey, feel free to follow along, connect, or collaborate. Let’s grow together.
